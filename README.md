Course Description
Builds on existing Linux automation and configuration skills by introducing Product Data/Product Lifecycle Management tools, custom code compilation and package creation. Includes administering, patching, and updating various development, testing, and production versions of server services and configuring internally facing services for Windows compatibility. Prereq: NTI-300 with a 2.0 or higher, or equivalent Linux automation experience (permission).

 

Course Objectives
 

   * Learn to configure interdependent linux applications necessary for a large or small network, including Bind, LDAP, rsyslog, NFS, Mail and Apache

   *  Learn to perform maintenance and effectively communicate changes to team mates through messaging, documentation, code updates and PM tools such as Jira.

   * Learn to compile customizations to applications into RPM and DEB packages

   * Learn to maintain a package repository and automate builds

   * Change and Project management

   * Pushing changes through Dev, Test and Prod 

   * We will continue with the notion that all machine states are ephemeral and a change has only been made if it is carried through to automation in our git repos so that the next instances spun up will contain that change.
